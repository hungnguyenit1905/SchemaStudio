# Refresh the checked-in snapshot of the Production CloudKit schema.
#
# CloudKit only creates record fields automatically in the Development
# environment. SchemaStudio pins both apps to Production, so a field added to a
# record type in code never reaches the server on its own: saving a record
# that carries an undeclared field makes CloudKit reject that record.
#
# ConnectionSyncField refuses to write any field that is not verified against
# this snapshot, and ProductionSchemaParityTests fails if the two disagree.
# After deploying a schema change in CloudKit Console, run this script and
# commit the result, then mark the field verified in ConnectionSyncSchema.swift.
#
# Requires a CloudKit management token:
#   xcrun cktool save-token --type management
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/export-cloudkit-schema.sh
